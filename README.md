# Huntsville-Craft-Beer-Wine-Trail
This project was developed as part of the Udacity Nanodegree in Frontend Development.

## Description

The objective of the project was to develop a single page application that would utilize Google Maps, the Knockoutjs framework and an additional 3rd party API. For my project, I utilized Google Maps with my API key, Foursquare with my API key, Knockoutjs. For inspiration, I drew upon the local brewery and wine bar scene in the Tennessee Valley, where it has recently exploded. The application allows the user to filter the map and list by typing in either Beer or Wine which triggers a knockout observable to filter by category. Selected markers bounce and once selected, an info window opens, providing more information such as name, address and foursquare web link. The application also resizes depending on the screen type.
